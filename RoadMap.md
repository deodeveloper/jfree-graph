# Road Map #
## Introduction ##

In this section I will try to layout the features I intend to implement. The same you will see in order of importance.

## Road map layout ##

  * **Add advance graph algorithms for optimal solutions:** This should include Dijkstra greedy shortest path algorithm, kruskal minimum spanning tree algorithm, topological sort and more.
  * **Flow algorithms:** Algorithms related to graph representation of flows.
  * **Approximate solutions for the knows NP problems:** We all know the this thorn in the foot NP problems, like the Salesman problem... :/ ...if not just wiki them. Still not all is lost!!! There are some nice algorithms that don't guaranty anything but work really good for most cases on this problems :).
  * **Graphic representation:** At some point something handy to show the graphs in the screen would be a nice thing to have.
  * **Multithreaded algorithms:** Now a days with all our cores in our machines, not trying to make use of them is just stupid. I ll attempt to implement as much algorithms as possible with a multithreading option.
  * **Thoughtful base of examples:** This I think is really important. And I don't mean the simple test cases libraries usually deliver, no sir, I mean some good examples on how graphs can be useful for everybody.
  * **Graph persistence:** Well this is big... but as I rule out other development stuff I would really like to dive into this.
  * **Research and innovation:** And you thought I couldn't say any crazier things...
