= Purpose =

jfree-graph is intended to provide a free easy to use and performing java graph library.

= Why am I doing this? =

This project started as I saw one day that a lot of skills learned in college got rusty as time passed. Specifically the typical math algorithm's we software engineers have to endure during our education. 

So I thought of making something to refresh memory (and update my knowledge). A graph library is something that might just do that. 

At the time of this writing I noticed a no official graph implementation for java exists and there are few (although pretty promising) free options. This is why I decided to release my work as an open source project.
