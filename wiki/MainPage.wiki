jfree-graph is intended to provide a free easy to use and performing java graph library.

= Introduction =

This project started as I saw one day that a lot of skills learned in college got rusty as time passed. Specifically the typical math algorithm's we software engineers have to endure during our education. 

So I thought of making something to refresh memory (and update my knowledge). A graph library is something that might just do that. 

At the time of this writing I noticed a no official graph implementation for java exists and there are few (although pretty promising) free options. This is why I decided to release my work as an open source project.

*12/19/2010 - Version 0.1.0 release*

I released the first version of the project. Its fully javadoc-documented and includes the following features:
  * Graph creation as a Adjacency Matrix Implementation. (Good for dense graphs)
  * Graph creation as a Adjacency Linked Map Implementation. (Good for sparse graphs)
  * Graph basic insert operations.
  * Graph basic traverse operations.
  * Node basic insert operations(on Arcs).
  * Node basic get operations(on Arcs).
