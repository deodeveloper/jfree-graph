The first think we need to do is to create our graph. At the moment of this writing there are 2 underlying implementations of the Graph interface: the _TestAdjacencyMatrixGraph_ (good for dense graphs) and the _AdjacencyMapGraph_ (good for sparse graphs).

For this example, we choose the _AdjacencyMapGraph_ :

{{{
Graph friendGraph = new AdjacencyMapGraph();
}}}

Next we will want to add some nodes as in the following image:

TODO: Add image of graph layout.

Adding nodes is as simple as:

{{{
Node burns = friendGraph.addNode(new Friend("Burns"));
Node peter = friendGraph.addNode(new Friend("Peter"));
Node homer = friendGraph.addNode(new Friend("Homer"));
Node stan  = friendGraph.addNode(new Friend("Stan"));
}}}

You might noticed that when adding a node I ma assigning a content to it, in this case a _Friend_ object. This content is required to implement the interface _Measurable_. We will talk more about it later.

Work in progress: Add a basic guide with examples to show how the library works
